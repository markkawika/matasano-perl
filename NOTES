Discovering block size: Three possibilities:

  1) Random prefix
  2) Fixed prefix
  3) No prefix

Start state: Assume random prefix. Encrypt the same text twice. If the ctext
is the same, no random prefix.

If no random prefix:

> Keep adding A's until you see a repeated block. There's a chance it will
> appear at 2*BS A's, and it's guaranteed at 3*BS-1 A's. If the repeated block
> appears at the start, it will appear at exactly 2*BS A's. Once you see a
> repeated block, you'll know the BS.

If random prefix:

] Keep adding A's until you see a repeated block. That will tell you the BS.

BS=3

Y is again what we want, and it always comes right before 3 X's
